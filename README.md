# zsvlib
 Zero runtime-allocation csv handling library in Zig

## use cases
- use case 1: tool to compute+dump typed description for necessary file sizes
- use case 2: tool to compute+dump typed description for necessary memory sizes
- use case 2: tool to combine multiple typed descriptions for necessary memory sizes
- use case 3: comptime layout generation for memory per csv line or whole file
- use case 4: library to use optionally SIMD for parsing data
- use case 5: library to write data to schemas.
* Opt-in of allocations with size must be possible.
- non-goal(for now): csv variations compatibility.
- non-goal: support fancy or many types
- non-goal: conversion to other formats
- non-goal: dealing with other string encoding than ascii and utf8
- non-goal: interaction besides the csv header generation
- non-goal(for now): updating offset to peek and write to file positions

## planned interfaces
todo

## status
wip.

## todos
- [ ] prototype csv parsing
- [ ] zig build
- [ ] describe how files are encoded (types + file sizes)
- [ ] describe how memory layouts are encoded (types + file sizes)
- [ ] describe how memory layouts are read at comptime (types + file sizes)
- [ ] implement how files are encoded (types + file sizes)
- [ ] implement how memory layouts are encoded (types + file sizes)
- [ ] implement how memory layouts are read at comptime (types + file sizes)
- [ ] tests headergen
- [ ] tests header reading
- [ ] tests codegen from header
- [ ] perf headergen
- [ ] perf header reading
- [ ] perf codegen from header
- [ ] simd csv parsing
- [ ] perf simd

## obsoletion plan
no plan for obsolation
