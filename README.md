# zsvlib
 Zero runtime-allocation csv handling library in Zig

## use cases
- use case 1: tool to compute+dump typed description for necessary file sizes
- use case 2: tool to compute+dump typed description for necessary memory sizes
- use case 2: tool to combine multiple typed descriptions for necessary memory sizes
- use case 3: comptime layout generation for memory per csv line or whole file
- use case 4: library to use optionally SIMD for parsing data
- use case 5: library to write data to schemas.
* Opt-in of allocations with size must be possible.
- non-goal(for now): csv variations compatibility.
- non-goal: support fancy or many types
- non-goal: conversion to other formats
- non-goal: dealing with other string encoding than ascii and utf8
- non-goal: interaction besides the csv header generation
- non-goal(for now): updating offset to peek and write to file positions

## instructions
```sh

# for benchmarks fetch zsv
git clone https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv
# todo
```

## planned interfaces
todo

## status
wip.

## todos
- [ ] prototype csv parsing
- [ ] zig build
- [ ] describe how files are encoded (types + file sizes)
- [ ] describe how memory layouts are encoded (types + file sizes)
- [ ] describe how memory layouts are read at comptime (types + file sizes)
- [ ] implement how files are encoded (types + file sizes)
- [ ] implement how memory layouts are encoded (types + file sizes)
- [ ] implement how memory layouts are read at comptime (types + file sizes)
- [ ] tests headergen
- [ ] tests header reading
- [ ] tests codegen from header
- [ ] perf headergen
- [ ] perf header reading
- [ ] perf codegen from header
- [ ] simd csv parsing
- [ ] perf simd
- [ ] float handling
- [ ] fixed point numbers etc

## obsoletion plan
no plan for obsolation

## notes

#### encoding examples for csv input without schema files
"string1\"string2" is 1 continuous string
number123 is another continuous string
65535 is a number, which is for simplicity of type Int (arbitrary precision integers) or
at request u16 (depending on what min and max values of same range are).
TODO: parsing Int?
TODO: field delimiter at comptime vs runtime
TODO: string symbols?
TODO: Is there "a best default" to choose at comptime? perf?

#### other implementations
- no realistic data handling https://github.com/geofflangdale/simdcsv
- extensible, in C and MIT: https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv
